# Server-XML-Sender

This is an networking program that creates a “server” and a “client”, which both communicate
using TCP/IP protocol style standards in their connections.
When both the server and client are connected, the client is prompted with a input asking for a tag word. 
This input is echoed to the server which searches api.flicker for sample xml data which contains the
inputted tag before echoing it back to the client.
